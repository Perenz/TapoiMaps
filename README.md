# TapoiMaps

 Implement an API allowing to evaluate the similarity of a user profile against a set of existing ones and to return the id of the most similar one. Attached you can find 4 profiles, each representing the topics discussed by a user together with the number of times each topic has been mentioned. Steps: 
+ 1. Propose a description of the system architecture. 
+ 2. Document the described API. 
+ 3. Implement the defined API. 
+ 4. Describe the matching algorithm used in order to identify, among the 4 available ones, the one most similar to the profile provided via API. 
+ 5. Prepare a dockerized version of your solution.
